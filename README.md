# -Google-Translate
In this project, I built a language translation model similar to Google Translate using Machine Learning and NLP techniques.
I worked on the entire pipeline starting from:

Data Preparation – I collected and preprocessed bilingual text datasets for training.

Model Design – I implemented a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural network with attention mechanism to handle context better.

Training – I trained the model to translate sentences from one language to another.

Testing – I validated the model by giving test inputs and checking how accurately it generates translations.

This project helped me understand how real-world translation systems work, covering everything from natural language processing, embeddings, encoder-decoder models, to evaluation of translation quality.

 Final Outcome: A working prototype that can translate sentences between two languages, demonstrating the core idea behind Google Translate.
